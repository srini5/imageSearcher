            <h1>Welcome to my 'Image Searcher MS' page</h1>

            
<p>This is a microservice which searches for images (using the <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn760784(v=bsynd.50).aspx' target='_blank'> image search api</a> which is internally used by <a href='https://www.bing.com/' target='_blank'>bing</a>) and returns results in paginated form.</p>

<h3>
Example usage:</h3>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <pre>
        Pass in a search string as a url parameter, and get back an array of search results in response.
        The response will be an array of objects containing the image url, page url and alt string.
        (Note that any spaces will get replaced by %20 by the browser automatically):
       
        For pagination, pass in the desired page number to be returned as a query param '?offset'
        If the offset parameter is not specified, then the first page will be returned by default.
        
        For changing the number of records returned in a page, pass the query param '?records'
        If the records parameter is not specified, then the number of records per page will default to 20.
